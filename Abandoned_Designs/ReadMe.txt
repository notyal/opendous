  Opendous Inc.'s Abandoned Designs are hardware designs which have been
deemed not currently commercially viable.  They may not meet specific design
goals, they may have limited appeal, Opendous Inc. may simply not be able to
produce them in large enough quantities, or sufficient support cannot be
offered.  Most have been prototyped and used at Opendous Inc.

  You may find these designs useful in whole or in part.  However, treat them
as shortcuts to your own projects and not as complete and viable products.

  At the very least these designs have editable schematics you can alter for
your own goals and the layout files have valid and tested component footprints.
All designs were created with the Open Source KiCAD EDA Suite.

  You can determine components used and their corresponding footprints by
comparing the schematic in eeschema and footprint details in CVpcb.

  If you are interested in details about any of these designs you may contact
Opendous Inc. through the Opendous Group (http://groups.google.com/group/opendous).
Spare PCBs and other design materials may still be gathering dust.
